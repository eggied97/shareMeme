Hello, this is the source code of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edeveloping.com.sharememe"> ShareMeme </a>.

This code is heavenly out-dated, and it looks like shit, it has repeadable code, it is messy, so please look throught that.

It uses a couple of librarys you need to compile your self:

  -<a href="https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu"> SlidingMenu </a>
  
  -<a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock"> ActionBarSherlock </a>
  
The rest of the librarys are added as '.jar' in the libs folder, maybe you need to add them manualy, but they are there.
